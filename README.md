# OOP Personal Project w/ Swift

**Concentration Game**
The project I chose was to follow a Stanford class that focused on Swift. The lessons mainly revolved around watching videos of the recorded classes(which were about an hr each). The main program we did was a game called concentration. The premise of the game is a card matching game. However we learned to optimized the games UI to orientation of user, optimization with code and performance and even adding more option to the game to make it more entertaining to the user like themes, randomization to cards ect.
**What is the project?**  
iOS game that focuses on matching cards.
**Who made it? Did you make it independently or with a team?**
  I made it with the helping of following tutorial videos.
**When did you make it? At what level of experience and proficiency were / are you?**
  I started it mid October 2019 but then jam packed the rest of the work towards the end of November and early December. I still feel like pretty nooby in Swift however the lessons were interesting and made me want to learn swift more.
**Why did you make it? For fun? For an assignment? How does it relect you as a person?**
  I made this for a assignment in my OOP class at FGCU during junior fall semester.
**Where did you make it? What school / class?** 
UNI FGCU, made mainly at home though.

Instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on someone's local machine for development and testing purposes.  
Note for real project: You want to be able to share your project and enable collaboration.  
Note for school project: You want a potential client or hirer to be able to run your program.

If your interested in making iOS apps, this couse was very intriguing.
Also coming up with new ideas that could make the game better are wecomed.

nothing much just slowly adding features.

Struct – no inheritance, are value types(ints, strings, arrays, dictionaries) (copy on write semantics)

Class – reference types

Access Control-protecting our internal implementations, is a bout having keywords in api that says to other groups u are ok to call this "wont break on u, how to use their code"

Good practice to make things private. :)

UIControl States:	A control can have more than one state at a time. Controls can be configured differently based on their state. For example, a [UIButton](http://apple-reference-documentation//hsOyO61dSB) object can be configured to display one image when it is in its normal state and a different image when it is highlighted.

Key words – infront of vars, structs, classes

-   Internal – this is the default it means "usable by any object in app" never really type in...
    
-   Public – outside framework
    
-   Open-anywhere
    
-   Three privates
    
    -   Private – callable from within this object
        
    -   Private(set) - only for vars, cant set but can get it
        
    -   Fileprivate – anything in that file can access eachother
